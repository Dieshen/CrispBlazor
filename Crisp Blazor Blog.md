# CRISP Blazor Blog

## Part 1: Introduction to the Overall CRISP Architecture

CRISP Blazor is a modular and scalable architecture designed to streamline the development of modern web applications using Blazor. The architecture is divided into three main areas: Shared, Client, and Server. Each area has a distinct role, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. Additionally, CRISP Blazor adopts a **Vertical Slice Architecture**, which organizes code by feature rather than technical layers, making it easier to navigate and maintain.

- **Shared Area**: Contains common models, interfaces, and utilities that are shared across the Client and Server.
- **Client Area**: Focuses on the front-end implementation using Blazor components and Razor pages.
- **Server Area**: Handles back-end logic, data access, and APIs, with a shift from traditional controllers to Minimal APIs for improved performance and simplicity.

This blog series will explore each area in detail, starting with the Shared area, followed by the Client and Server areas. We will also discuss the architectural decisions and benefits of using CRISP Blazor.

## Part 2: Going Over the Shared Area

The Shared area is the backbone of the CRISP Blazor architecture. It contains all the common elements that are used by both the Client and Server. This includes:

### Sample Folder Structure

```
BlazorREPR.Shared/
  Models/
    BaseAuditableModel.cs
    BaseEntityModel.cs
  Interfaces/
    IRequestService.cs
    IRequest.cs
  Utilities/
  Requests/
  Responses/
    ...
```

- **Models**: Base models like `BaseAuditableModel` and `BaseEntityModel` that define the structure of data entities.
- **Interfaces**: Contracts such as `IEventHandler`, `IFileService`, and `IModelService` that enforce consistency across implementations.
- **Utilities**: Helper classes and methods that provide reusable functionality.

By centralizing these components, the Shared area ensures that the Client and Server can operate seamlessly without duplicating code. This approach promotes reusability and reduces maintenance overhead.

## Part 3: Going Over the Client Area

The Client area is where the user interface comes to life. Built with Blazor, it leverages Razor components to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Key features of the Client area include:

### Sample Folder Structure

```
BlazorREPR.Client/
    MainLayout.razor
    RedirectToLogin.razor
    Modules/
        ProjectManagement/
            Components/
            Models/
            Pages/
            Requests/
            Services/
```

- **Layouts**: Components like `MainLayout.razor` define the overall structure and styling of the application.
- **Pages**: Razor pages that handle specific routes and user interactions.
- **Modules**: Modular components that encapsulate specific functionalities, such as `ProjectManagement`.

The Client area is designed to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience, making full use of Blazor's capabilities to deliver a modern web application.

## Part 4: Going Over the Server Area

The Server area is responsible for the back-end logic and data management. It includes features like data access, authentication, and API endpoints. One of the most significant shifts in the Server area is the move from traditional controllers to Minimal APIs.

### Sample Folder Structure

```
BlazorREPR/
    Data/
    Modules/
        ProjectManagement/
            PMModule.cs
            Configurations/
            Endpoints/
            Entities/
    Services/
```

### Why Minimal APIs?

Minimal APIs offer a lightweight and efficient way to define API endpoints. Unlike traditional controllers, Minimal APIs:

- Require less boilerplate code.
- Provide better performance due to reduced overhead.
- Are easier to set up and maintain.

In CRISP Blazor, Minimal APIs are used to handle requests and responses efficiently, ensuring a smooth integration with the Client area. This shift aligns with modern development practices and enhances the overall performance of the application.
